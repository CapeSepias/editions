**Note on installing Xcode:** If you are on a GNM machine chances are the App Store isn't working for you â€“ [click here](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/) to get a direct download.

If you're starting from scratch, we recommend starting out with Android Studio because it takes less time to download.
